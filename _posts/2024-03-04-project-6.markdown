## üõ†Ô∏è Does

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

### **Designing interactive and educational projects**  
 
We develop short and engaging gamified modules that invite members of the scientific community to actively interact with content. These modules are designed to spark curiosity, encourage self-assessment of scientific intuitions, and feature science-inspired short stories and poems.

### **Combining expertise within the field of cognitive science**

We combine expertise from neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology to create modules that are both fun and informative. This interdisciplinary foundation enables the platform to offer a diverse range of activities for the broader scientific community.

### **Sharing resources**

We offer a growing library of scientific prompts, mini-games, and literary spin-offs, designed for the broader scientific community.

## üéØ What

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Five modules</h3>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">*real or not real?*</h4>

It can be difficult to tell what information is real and what is fake, especially with the rise of AI-generated news and science content and clickbait marketing tactics. We present a few examples for you to read and decide whether the information is real or not real, underlining the importance of reading thoroughly about a topic before believing the first thing you hear!

<h4 style="text-align: left;">*wordle*</h4>

Our wordles feature basic neuroscience terminologies, offering a light and fun game for all :D

<h4 style="text-align: left;">connections*</h4>

The connections game invites players to group related neuroscience terms or concepts, ranging from brain regions named after scientists to color-based idioms for emotions. 

<h4 style="text-align: left;">*multiple choice*</h4>

Pick THE one!

<h4 style="text-align: left;">*stories and poems*</h4>

Literary expressions that bring curiosity, wonder, and reflection into dialogue with scientific ideas are values and appreciated.
