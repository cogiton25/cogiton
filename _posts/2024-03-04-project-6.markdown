## üõ†Ô∏è Does

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Designing interactive and educational projects</h3>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

 We develop short and engaging gamified modules that invite members of the scientific community to actively interact with content. These modules are designed to spark curiosity, encourage self-assessment of scientific intuitions, and feature science-inspired short stories and poems.

</div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Combining expertise within the field of cognitive science</h3>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

We combine expertise from neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology to create modules that are both fun and informative. This interdisciplinary foundation enables the platform to offer a diverse range of activities for the broader scientific community.

## üéØ What

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Five modules</h3>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">real or not real?</h4>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

It can be difficult to tell what information is real and what is fake, especially with the rise of AI-generated news and science content and clickbait marketing tactics. We present a few examples for you to read and decide whether the information is real or not real, underlining the importance of reading thoroughly about a topic before believing the first thing you hear!

</div>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">wordle</h4>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

Our wordles feature basic neuroscience terminologies, offering a light and fun game for all :D

</div>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">connections</h4>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

The connections game invites players to group related neuroscience terms or concepts, ranging from brain regions named after scientists to color-based idioms for emotions. 

</div>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">multiple choice</h4>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

Pick THE one!

</div>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">stories and poems</h4>

<div style="text-align: left;"> 

Literary expressions that bring curiosity, wonder, and reflection into dialogue with scientific ideas are values and appreciated.
